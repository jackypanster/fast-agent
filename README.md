# K8s Copilot

An interactive AI assistant to manage Kubernetes with natural language, powered by `fast-agent` and modern LLMs.

This project aims to create a "K8s Copilot" that allows developers, testers, and operations engineers to interact with Kubernetes clusters using simple, conversational language. It dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for K8s and improves day-to-day operational efficiency.
